# File Format
The file formats presented here are .glm files used in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) open source distribution analysis tool GridLAB-D. 
If you are unfamiliar with .glm files, you can use the National Renewable Energy Lab's open source tool DiTTo to convert .glm files to other formats, 
including CYME or OPEN-DSS file formats. An explanation of using DiTTo to convert file formats can be found here: https://nrel.github.io/ditto/cli-examples/

All of the modified testcases presented here are overloaded versions of the original, denoted by the "OV" at the end of the file name.
